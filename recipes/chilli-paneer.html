		<p>Chilli Paneer is a popular Indo-Chinese dish made by stir-frying cubes of paneer (Indian cottage cheese) with bell peppers, onions, and green chilies in a tangy, spicy sauce. The sauce is typically made from a blend of soy sauce, vinegar, chili sauce, and ketchup, giving it a balance of heat, sweetness, and tanginess. The paneer is often coated in a light batter and shallow fried before being tossed in the sauce, creating a crispy texture. It can be served as a snack, appetizer, or a main dish with fried rice or noodles.It's a perfect fusion of Indian flavors with a Chinese cooking style!</p>
