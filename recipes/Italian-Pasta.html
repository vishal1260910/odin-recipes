		<p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
		<ul>
			<li>200g spaghetti or any pasta</li>
			<li>4-5 garlic cloves (thinly sliced)</li>
			<li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon chili flakes (adjust to taste)</li>
			<li>1 zucchini (sliced)</li>
			<li>1 cup cherry tomatoes (halved)</li>
			<li>1/2 cup broccoli (blanched)</li>
			<li>Fresh basil leaves (optional)</li>
			<li>Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
			<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
		</ul>
		<p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
			<ol>
			<li>Cook the Pasta:

			Boil pasta in salted water according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside, reserving 1/4 cup of pasta water.</li>
			<li>Sauté Vegetables:

			In a pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
			Add sliced zucchini, broccoli, and cherry tomatoes. Sauté until the vegetables are slightly tender but still have a crunch. Remove and set aside.</li>
			<li>Prepare the Garlic Oil:

			In the same pan, add the rest of the olive oil and sliced garlic. Cook on low heat until the garlic turns golden and fragrant (but not burnt).
			Add chili flakes and stir for a few seconds.</li>
			<li>Toss the Pasta:

			Add the cooked pasta to the pan, along with the sautéed vegetables. Toss everything together, ensuring the pasta is coated in the garlic-chili oil.
			If it feels too dry, add a bit of the reserved pasta water to create a light sauce.</li>
			<li>Season and Serve:

			Season with salt, pepper, and fresh basil leaves (if using).
			Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese if you like	</li>
